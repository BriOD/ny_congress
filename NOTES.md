user will enter ny_congress
  shows a list of all NY districts
    1-27, maybe list by district location

Will ask used which district they want more info about.    





What is a district?
  1. has a number
  2. has a location
  3. has a representative
  4. has contact info


  Where I'll scrape from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_congressional_districts

I want to:
  - go to website, find the districts
  - extract the attributes
  - instantiate a district object
